Installation
------------

### Download and Installation

There are two methods to install NCWunderground.

#### 1. Download from Cydia

Coming Soon.

#### 2. Compile from Source

Run the following commands on your command line to download the source:

```
git clone git://github.com/andrewmm/ncwunderground.git
cd ncwunderground
git submodule init
```

Then you can run `make` to compile the code or `make package` to compile and create a .deb package. You can also run:

```
export THEOS_DEVICE_IP=your.phone.ip.address
make package install
```

This will compile the code, create a .deb, SSH it over to your phone (you will need to have SSH installed and enabled), and respring.

### Enable and Configure

Navigate to `Settings > Notifications > Weather Underground`. Turn on the Notification Center switch to enable the widget. On the `Settings > Notifications` screen you can also drag entries around to sort them.

Configure the options. The widget will download data from the Weather Underground server whenever the Notification Center is opened, so long as it has not downloaded data in the last N minutes, where N is set by the Data Refresh Delay option.

Hourly Forecast Length controls the number of hours that are included in the sparkline display and the min/max calculations on one of the pages.

You will need to enter your own Weather Underground API key in order to use the widget. This enables me to release it for free. To get an API key, go to http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/edit.html. Select the "Anvil Plan" and the "Developer" option. Then copy the API key into the relevant settings field.

Thanks
------

The widget is built on top of the BBWeeApp protocol.

This project was built using the theos build system by DHowett (https://github.com/DHowett/theos).

It uses Sparklines by abelsey to display houly forecasts (https://github.com/abelsey/Sparklines).

The settings menu is created using WeePreferenceLoader by aricha (https://github.com/aricha/WeePreferenceLoader).

Thanks to [maxps](https://github.com/maxps) and [newtux](https://github.com/newtux) for beta testing.
