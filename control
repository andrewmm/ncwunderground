 This is a Notification Center widget that displays weather information from Weather Underground. To enable the widget and set your preferences, go to Settings/Notifications/Weather Underground.
 
 To use the widget you will need your own API Key from Weather Underground (this ensures that the app can remain free.)

Enter your API Key on the preferences page at Settings/Notifications/Weather Underground.
